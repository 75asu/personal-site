## Hey, I'm Asutosh 👋

On the internet, they call me `75asu` — a software engineer who’s equal parts DevOps wizard and full-stack builder. I write Go like poetry, automate like a lazy genius, and occasionally convince JavaScript to behave.

Been at it for 5 years — building, breaking, teaching, and occasionally googling “why is my YAML not working.”

## 🛠️ What I Bring to the Table

- **Go & Python Dev**: From microservices to system tools — if it runs fast, I probably built it.
- **Full-Stack Engineering**: Need a slick UI + a robust backend + secure infra? I speak MERN *and* Kubernetes fluently.
- **DevOps & Automation**: CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows, cloud infra that doesn't collapse at scale — all in a day’s work.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: I catch bugs before they party in production.

## ⚡ Cool Stuff I’ve Built

- **[DevOps Gallery](https://github.com/exitAsutosh/devops-gallery)**: Real-world DevOps setups — infra as code and battle-tested.
- **[Go Gallery](https://github.com/exitAsutosh/go-gallery)**: Microprojects in Go — lean, mean, and super clean.
- **[Frontend Gallery](https://github.com/exitAsutosh/frontend-gallery)**: Web apps and UIs because the frontend deserves some love too.

## 📚 I Also Teach

Every summer and winter, I run full-stack dev bootcamps for college students.  
3 batches done, dozens of careers started, and yes — we do actual project work, not just “To-Do apps.”

> Want to collaborate or invite me to teach? Hit me up. I promise the vibes are better than your average classroom.

## 💼 Consulting & Freelance

Startups and small teams — if you need someone who can build your product *and* your infra, I’m your guy.  
I speak business goals as well as bash scripts.

Whether it's DevOps cleanup, platform engineering, or full-stack MVPs — let's make it work.
