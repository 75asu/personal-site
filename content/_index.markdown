## Hey, I'm Asutosh 👋

You can find me as `75asu` in the internet. I'm a software engineer, a DevOps tinkerer, a Go enthusiast, and your friendly neighborhood automation wizard. Been building stuff for 5 years — and breaking things (intentionally!) to learn faster.

## 🔧 My Superpowers

- **Automation**: I make machines do the boring work — faster, better, forever.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Shipping code like it’s on a conveyor belt.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: I see dead servers... before they die.

## 🎯 Currently Hooked On

- **GitOps**: Because manual configs are sooo last season.
- **MLOps**: Gluing machine learning to reality — one pipeline at a time.

## 🚀 Project Zones

- **[DevOps Gallery](https://github.com/exitAsutosh/devops-gallery)**: Real-world DevOps scenarios — less theory, more chaos-taming.
- **[Go Gallery](https://github.com/exitAsutosh/go-gallery)**: Micro projects in Go — built for speed and clarity.
- **[Frontend Gallery](https://github.com/exitAsutosh/frontend-gallery)**: Because pretty UIs matter too (and I respect CSS warriors).

## 🎓 Teaching Bytes

I run full-stack bootcamps for college students during summers and winters.  
Three batches done, many more queued. Students call it fun. I call it **code therapy**.

> Want to join or collaborate on a session? Ping me. I don’t bite (unless your code is `chmod 777` everywhere 😅).

## 🤝 Consulting & Collabs

Startups, solopreneurs, small teams — if you’re building something cool and need help with DevOps, automation, or scaling your infra without melting your wallet, I’m all ears (and scripts).  
Let’s chat — I might just be the caffeine your project needs.
