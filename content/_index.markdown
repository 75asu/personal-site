## About Me

I'm Asutosh Panda, known as `75asu` around the internet, a software engineer who loves tinkering with Golang, MERN, Backend, and DevOps. It's been 4 years since the journey started.

### What I Do Best 

Automation, CI/CD, Monitoring and Observability are my daily bread and butter. 

### Latest Obsession 

Currently, I'm building side projects for fun - terminal apps, tiny simple servers and other apps using Go .

### Projects
